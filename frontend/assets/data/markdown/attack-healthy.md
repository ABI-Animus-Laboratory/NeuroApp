The models used to simulate neuron activity are designed to reflect the behaviour of a real neuron; however, they are not exactly the same. There are many different neuron models with varying levels of complexity and accuracy. Previously we have seen the leaky integrate-and-fire neuron model. 

Another neuron model we will look at is the Hodgkin-Huxley model. This model is more complex than the leaky integrate-and-fire model, incorporating additional components to account for the lipid bilayer of the cell, voltage-gated ion channels, leak channels, electrochemical gradients, and ion pumps. 

Multiple variables within the Hodgkin-Huxley model can be adjusted to modify the behaviour of the neuron in response to an input current. Two such variables are the capacity of the membrane and the potassium peak conductance.

Use the sliders of the right to adjust the input current, capacity of the membrane, and potassium peak conductance. Observe the changing membrane potential of the neuron in response to the changing inputs.
