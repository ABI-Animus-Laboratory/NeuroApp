<p> Neurons (nerve cells) are what make up the brain and the nervous system. A neuron transfers messages across the body in the form of electrical signals. These electrical signals are called action potentials (also known as nerve impulses or spikes). An action potential occurs when the difference in the electrical potential between the inside and outside of a cell, referred to as the membrane potential, increases rapidly and falls. This change in the cell's membrane potential then initiates a change in adjacent cells' membrane potential. 

The leaky integrate and fire model approximates a neuron as a leaky resistor and a capacitor in parallel. A current source is used to charge up the capacitor to produce a potential. In the same way as a biological neuronâ€™s action potential, when this potential is above the threshold potential, the capacitor discharges to a resting potential. For low currents, the potential will never exceed the threshold potential and a spike will never occur. The leaky aspect of this model represents the diffusion of ions through the membrane which changes the membrane potential. 

This interactive simulation represents the behaviour of a neuron in response to an input current using the leaky integrate-and-fire model. Specify the input current using the slider to the right and observe the dynamic membrane potential of the neuron on the graph. </p>
