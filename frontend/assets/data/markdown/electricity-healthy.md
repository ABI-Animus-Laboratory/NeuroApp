<p>The nervous system is made up of billions of neurons. To send messages across the body, the electrical signals must be transferred between neurons. Communication between neurons occurs through synapses, which allow one neuron to transfer the electrical signals to another neuron. Synapses can be either chemical or electrical (Kandel et al., 2013): 

Chemical synapse: The electrical signal in the first neuron triggers the release of a chemical called a neurotransmitter which binds to the other neuron and initiates an electrical response. 

Electrical synapse: The two neurons are connected by gap junctions which allow for the transfer of electrical current. This way, changes in the electrical potential of the pre-synaptic neuron results in changes in the electrical potential of the post-synaptic neuron. 

This simulation uses two leaky integrate-and-fire model neurons connected together by a synapse. When an action potential occurs in the first neuron, a change in membrane potential occurs in the second neuron. 

The model used for this synapse incorporates spike time dependent plasticity. Spike time dependent plasticity is where the strength of the connection between the neurons depends on the timing of output and input action potentials.

Use the slider on the right to adjust the current input into the first neuron and observe the effect on the membrane potential of both neurons.</p>
