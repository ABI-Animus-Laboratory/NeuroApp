This simulation displays a network of 9 connected neurons, each represented as spheres. The arrows represent the connections between neurons.

Click on any of the 9 neurons to adjust the input current and membrane capacitance of that specific neuron.

Click on any of the arrows to adjust the weight of the connection.

Adjust the properties within the network and click 'Start' to run the simulation.

The membrane potential of each neuron can be observed after the simulation by clicking on the corresponding sphere.

Use 'Clear' to reset the network objects to their starting colours while maintaining the network values.

Use 'Reset Network' to reset all the network values and object colours.
